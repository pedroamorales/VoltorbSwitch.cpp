        Author's note: 
            This class is basically very similar to the gameTile class since ultimately, they are both tiles.
            Difference is that this class has a lot of differing information on it. This class is the edge tiles that display 
            the total number of bombs and total number of points. There are gonna be less comments since they are very similar.

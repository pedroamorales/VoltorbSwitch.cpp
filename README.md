# Voltorb Switch MiniGame
1. This project is based on the Voltorb Switch mini game from Pokemon DSi games.

## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's "apps/myApps/" directory
2. Run the command "make" in the terminal or the "Build" Task in VSCode.
3. To run the project using the included debug configurations you must open the "launch.json" file
found in ".vscode/". In "launch.json" change the "program" attribute for the corresponding configuration (according to your OS)
to reflect the path to your executable. The executable will have the same name as this repository, and if on Windows, it 
will end in ".exe"

## Game Guide
- Voltorb Switch is a minigame based on the original 'Voltorb Flip' from the Pok√©mon game versions, HeartGold and SoulSilver. While it is a game of chance, there are a few things you can do to significantly increase the chances of winning.

- Flip over all cards in lines where the number of Voltorb is zero.
  
- Open your memo. First, in any line with a value of zero, mark all cards as Voltorb. Second, in any row or column where the line value and the number of Voltorb add up to five, mark every card in that line with a 1. These cards are not worth flipping over because they are either 1 (which will not help you) or a Voltorb.

- You can start flipping over cards now. Make sure to keep a few things in mind while doing this; seek additional tips online.
